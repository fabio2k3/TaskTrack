TaskTrack is a full-stack web application for managing daily tasks and tracking productivity over time.

The application allows users to:
- Create, edit, and delete daily tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or pending
- Store task history in a database
- View statistics such as completed tasks, completion rates, and productivity trends

The frontend is built using React, while the backend is developed in Python, exposing a REST API and handling data persistence.  
This project is designed as a learning-oriented yet production-ready system, focusing on clean architecture, scalability, and real-world development practices.
